2.6.3 :001 > docking_station = DockingStation.new
Traceback (most recent call last):

NameError (uninitialized constant DockingStation)


The filepath where the error happened is: /lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/irb-1.0.0/exe/irb:11

Error line number is: 11.

One way of solving it would be to write a DockingStation class to which the code can refer to.
